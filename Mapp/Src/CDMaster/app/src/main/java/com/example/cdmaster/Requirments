********Security Requirment******
FIrmware:

1) Bootloader:
   It is observed that device going to bootloader some times and on power cycle comes back..check Root cause
   If In Bootloader device can be in commisiond state OR un commsion state
   => if uncommision state shared factory key is 0xFFFF DDAA .. DD AA are Device key and app key
   => if commisiond state shared fectory key is 0xPQRX DDAA .. PQRX is shared secret key loaded
   => 0xPQRX is loaded into application in fectory , PRocees : flash BL , Flash APP using 0xFFFF, Load 0x$$$$

   command/responce encription:
   cmd: [Command][Payload][Checksum]
   resp: [Responce][Payload][Checksum]
   Command and Responce are never encripted
   Payload and Checksum are encripted with PQDDRXAA
