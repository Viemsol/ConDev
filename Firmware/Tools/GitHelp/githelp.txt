git add file1.txt # will replace the staged file with changes 

# lets say you want some files to be ignored by git , shuld not be shown modifed and you dont want them to be pushed 
touch .gitignore #touch command creates file , will crate file named .gitignore , like software logs to be ignored 
#now put all fils names to be ignored in this .gitignore lat say file1.txt 
git status # will not show file1.txt modifed but will show .gitignore

#now lt say you want to ignore all files with extetion .log then add *.log to .gitignore and commit .gitignore
#now let say you want to ignore complete dirctory then add foldername/ to .gitignore and commit .gitignore and changes in that directoy will be ignored
#NOTE it will ignore all the folder with foldername, for specific floder use /foldername/, will ignor foldername inside repo but not within other folder which have folder name as foldername, inside folders to ignore use floder1name/folder2name , will ignore folder2name
git diff # this comares filse in working dir vs staging
git diff --staged #this will compare stage area with last commit
git commit -a -m "commit direct" # this will stage and commit all changed files  #NOTE:  untracked file will not commited (ie.newly crated files)
rm file1.txt # will remove file and also will put in satging # NOTE if you delete file manually , you need to commad git aaa and then git commit
git commit -m "removed file1.txt" # now file is deleted

######renaming the file and put into stage
git mv file1.txt file1_rename.txt # will rename the file1.txt and stage it

#####if file is added to ignore list , when its alredy tracked ie commited , then we need to explicity run below command
git rm --cached file1.txt

####unstaging the file
git restore --staged file1.txt # will move back file from staged to unstaged

#unmodifing any file to content of commit
git checkout --file1.txt # will replace content of file1.txt in working dir to commit one

#this will mache all directory content to the last commit, all modified content will go away
git checkout -f
